You are standing at the end of a road before a dark and dank cave. The forest is covering the
road lending a dark and
spooky aspect to the road. You hear a low wailing that seems to be coming from the cave.

Cavern
You enter a large cavern. You are surprised to find that the walls of the cave are glowing so you
have no problem
seeing the large stalactites that have formed. To the east you hear the sound of rushing water.
To the north you hear
strange sounds that sound like someone with a broken heart. You see as set of stairs at the west
end of the cavern.

Spooky Cave
You have entered a dark twisting, tunnel that seems to wind around the Cavern. The low wailing
you heard before has
risen to a screech that is making your hair stand on end. You see a sign that says "Proceed at
your own risk. Anyone
entering this area will be eaten.

Chasm
The room is massive and imposing, with walls that seem to stretch up to the heavens.
A chasm splits the room in two, its jagged edges plunging down into the darkness,
creating a sense of danger and mystery.

Graveyard
You enter a creepy graveyard, and it is a desolate and abandoned place, with tilted and weather-worn headstones rising
up from the overgrown grass. A thick mist hangs in the air, and the only sound is the mournful hoot of an owl,
adding to the eerie atmosphere of the place.

Clear Lake
The clear lake is surrounded by a dense forest of tall trees, casting ominous shadows on its still surface.
The lake is eerily calm, without a single ripple disturbing its glassy surface, creating a haunting and surreal atmosphere.
